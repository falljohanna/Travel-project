        The city is sometimes referred to as ‘Venice of the North’, 
        thanks to its beautiful buildings and exquisite architecture, 
        abundant open water and numerous parks. <br>
        The total absence of heavy industry makes Stockholm one of the world’s cleanest metropolises. <br>
        The people of Stockholm are dependent on the service industry for their daily bread, 
        which accounts for 85% of the jobs in the city. <br>
