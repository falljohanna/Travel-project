        Facts About Stockholm and Sweden
        Stockholm is often known as the ‘World’s Smallest Big City’ or the ‘World’s 
        Biggest Small Town’. Find out what a walkable city Stockholm is on our Stockholm 
        Private Old Town Walking Tour & Vasa Museum. <br>
        Stockholm’s oldest surviving building is The Riddarholmen Church, a Franciscan 
        monastery built in 1270. <br>
        In 1710, a catastrophic plague obliterated about one third of Stockholm’s population. <br>
        The city became the venue for the award of the first Nobel Prizes, in the year 1901. <br>
        Stockholm Globe Arena is currently the largest hemispherical building in the world. <br>
        The city’s subway is also known as the world’s longest art gallery, 
        with the majority of its stations being adorned with paintings, sculptures and mosaics. <br>

        The city is sometimes referred to as ‘Venice of the North’, 
        thanks to its beautiful buildings and exquisite architecture, 
        abundant open water and numerous parks. <br>
        The total absence of heavy industry makes Stockholm one of the world’s cleanest metropolises. <br>
        The people of Stockholm are dependent on the service industry for their daily bread, 
        which accounts for 85% of the jobs in the city. <br>
        Stockholm houses two UNESCO World Heritage sites – the Royal Palace Drottningholm 
        and the The Woodland Cemetery. Book your Private Day Trip to Drottningholm Palace.
